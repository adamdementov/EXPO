Output: A string example of a structured sentence [string structured] will be the



---- Breakdown of Tasks -----
Alex ==> 1. Read: read in document of text and algorithm to recognize sentence
         2. Split: split sentence into different words into classes

Adam ==> 3. Creating dictionary plugin

My ==>   4. Sorting algorithm: sort string of classes of words and use plugin of dictionary to categorize word (class, type)

My ==>   5. Syntax: look at type and position

break sentence into words --> class
categorize each word
